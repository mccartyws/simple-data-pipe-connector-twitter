> Hey there! So you want to build your own Simple Data Pipe connector? [Start here](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe-connector-template/wiki/How-to-build-a-Simple-Data-Pipe-connector-using-this-template).

# Simple Data Pipe OAuth sample connector 

This [Simple Data Pipe](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe/) connector template illustrates how to 

* define OAuth connectivity for a cloud data source,
* load a static set of data sets (2016 election speeches) and
* store the results in Cloudant.

### Pre-requisites

##### General 
 This sample connector illustrates how to implement OAuth connectvity for a cloud data source, such as [reddit](http://www.reddit.com).
 A valid reddit user id is required to create and run a Simple Data pipe that fetches a small data set for illustrative purposes. 

##### Deploy the Simple Data Pipe

 [Deploy the Simple Data Pipe in Bluemix](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe) using the Deploy to Bluemix button or manually.

##### Services

This connector does not require any additional Bluemix service.


##### Install the Simple Data Pipe OAuth sample connector 

  When you [follow these steps to install this connector](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe/wiki/Installing-a-Simple-Data-Pipe-Connector), add the following line to the dependencies list in the `package.json` file: 

  ```
  "simple-data-pipe-connector-oauth-template": "https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe-connector-oauth-template.git"
  ```

##### Enable OAuth support and collect connectivity information

 You need to register the Simple Data Pipe application before you can use it to load data.
 1. Open the [reddit](http.reddit.com) web page and log in.
 2. Click **Preferences** and select the **apps** tab.
 3. **Create another app...**
 4. Assign an application **name** and enter an optional **description**.
 5. As _redirect URL_ enter `https://<simple-data-...mybluemix.net>/auth/passport/callback`.
   > Replace `<simple-data-...mybluemix.net>` with the fully qualified host name of your Simple Data Pipe application on Bluemix.

 6. Click **create app**.
 7. Copy the application id displayed under your application name (e.g. vv5ulJR3...20Q) and the secret (e.g. j60....CFSyAmSY).


### Using the Simple Data Pipe OAuth sample connector 

To configure and run a pipe

1. Open the Simple Data Pipe web console.
2. Select __Create A New Pipe__.
3. Select __Sample OAuth Data Source__ for the __Type__ when creating a new pipe  
4. In the _Connect_ page, enter the _application id_ and _secret_ from the reddit app preferences page. 
5. Select the data set (or data sets) to be loaded.
6. Schedule or run the data pipe now.
